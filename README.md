# gosexy/to

*Convenient* functions for converting between common Go datatypes.

This is an *experimental package* it avoids error handling and reporting, if
any conversion cannot be done, a zero value will be always returned.

Life is too short for properly catching trivial conversion errors.

## Installing

```sh
go get github.com/gosexy/to
```

## Usage

Import the package

```go
import "github.com/gosexy/to"
```

Convert something

```go
i, err := to.Convert("567", reflect.Int64)
// 567, nil

a := to.String(1)
// "1"
b := to.String(1.1)
// "1.1"
c := to.String(true)
// "true"

a := to.Int("1")
// 1
b := to.Int("-1")
// -1
b := to.Int("")
// 0

a := to.Float32("1.4")
// 1.4
b := to.Float32("A")
// 0.0

a := to.Bool("true")
// true
b := to.Bool("f")
// false
```
