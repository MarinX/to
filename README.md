# menteslibres.net/gosexy/to

*Convenient* functions for converting between common Go datatypes.

This is an *experimental package* it aims to be as quiet as possible so it
avoids error handling **on pourpose**, if any conversion is not possible and
can't be done, a zero value is always guaranteed to be returned.

Please be aware that not every Go program can benefit from avoiding conversion
errors, I've found that dealing with user input or JSON data are scenarios
where having a zero value is more convenient than trying to make the user feed
appropriate data.

Life is too short for properly catching trivial conversion errors.

## Installing

```sh
go get menteslibres.net/gosexy/to
```

## Usage

Import the package

```go
import "menteslibres.net/gosexy/to"
```

Convert something

```go
i, err := to.Convert("567", reflect.Int64)
// 567, nil

a := to.String(1)
// "1"
b := to.String(1.1)
// "1.1"
c := to.String(true)
// "true"

a := to.Int64("1")
// 1
b := to.Int64("-1")
// -1
b := to.Int64("")
// 0

a := to.Float64("1.4")
// 1.4
b := to.Float64("A")
// 0.0

a := to.Bool("true")
// true
b := to.Bool("f")
// false
```
